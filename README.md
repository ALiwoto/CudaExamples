# CudaExamples

A repository containing multiple examples of Cuda programming language for beginners, with step-by-step examples and chapters I personally used to learn the language!

At the time of writing this repository, I am also a beginner, so don't expect too much from it.

> NOTE: You are expected to know at least basic C++ before starting this tutorial series.

## Getting started

1. Make sure you have Visual Studio installed, from [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
2. Download Cuda Toolkit from [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
3. Make sure everything is installed correctly by running `nvcc --version`.
4. You are ready to go through the codes in this repository!

You can then start reading from [Chapter1](./Chapters/Chapter1/Chapter1_1.md).

Make sure to run each code yourself to actually see what is happening and then read the explanation of each section! Good luck.

## Contributing

You are more than welcome to contribute to this repository by fixing my mistakes or adding new examples/chapters! Thanks for your consideration in advance!
